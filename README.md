# SPO365-JavaScript
## Quick and simple JavaScript on SPO365 {SharePoint Online}

Sometimes we want to test JavaScript code to Site based on SharePoint Online. But we have some issues:
1. we can't Develop WebPart using SharePoint Framework SPFX
2. we don't have access to upload file *.sppkg to SharePoint Online
3. we don't have Script Editor {Modern} in SharePoint Online

In summary, details in below:

We can use file **01 Quick JavaScript to SharePoint Online.js**, then execute code in Console {Browser - Developer Tools}, for testing JavaScript that we want:

While executing JavaScript code in Console, Site based on SharePoint Online will appear as below:

Result of execution, some files have been uploaded to SharePoint Online:
